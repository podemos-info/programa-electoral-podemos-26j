	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: New system of access to public teaching positions." />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will establish a new access system for public teaching positions based on
criteria of objectivity and transparency, in which specific subject knowledge
will be evaluated as well as pedagogic skills and professional abilities, with
an extended practice period, taking into consideration both professional and
academic merits.

We will revise and create a new model of substitution pools which will give
centres a more stable work force (at present there is a high percentage of
employment instability).

Furthermore, we live in an evolving social context with transforming cultures
and pedagogic innovations which do not require a static form of education.
Therefore we will promote a work force of professionals who are prepared for
innovation, evolution, flexibility and responsibility, establishing an initial
training which assures a solid pedagogic training and practice suitable to new
methodologies and educational challenges. We understand that professional
development must come about throughout a teaching career, a fact which will
encourage training in gender equality and co-education, bullying, multi-cultural
values and in respect for the environment as well as working with families and
in the design of programmes to promote equality." />
