	<meta property="og:description" content="During the Spanish mandate in the UN Security Council (which expires at the end
of 2016) we will raise the proposed speeding-up of a more democratic,
transparent and representative comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council
with the intention of abolishing the power of veto and prioritizing a mandate
oriented to the defence of human rights, gender equality, protection of
civilians, the dynamics of dialogue and local leadership in crisis management.

While such reform does not occur, we will promote a formal commitment not to use
the veto power in humanitarian issues (cases of genocide, war crimes or crimes
against humanity), as a first step towards the eventual abolition of this
prerogative." />
