	<meta property="og:description" content="We will guarantee public employees the recovery of their purchasing power and
the rights that were taken from them in recent years in the name of austerity.

We will recover labour rights directly related to reconciling family and
professional life, including the system of paid leave, paid holidays and pension
rights.

We will review public sector pensions contracted over the last four years, based
on reduced payments. To prevent any former elected official joining the board of
directors of companies operating in strategic state sectors." />
