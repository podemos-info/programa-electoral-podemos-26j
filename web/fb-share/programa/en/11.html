	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Guarantee by law of access to a minimum power supply" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a statutory law that guarantees access to a minimum power
supply. We consider access to energy as a public service, whether it is managed
by public or private institutions. There will be no cutting of electrical power
or gas in the case of the usual home of the consumer and when the non-payment of
bills is due to reasons beyond their control and, especially, due to situations
of poverty.

A living minimum of electrical power and gas per month per home will be
established. Once a situation of poverty is confirmed, the payment of this
living minimum supply will never exceed 10% of the monthly income of the home.
Social services will determine the accurate payment of this minimum supply in
each home in a situation of poverty. The consumer will have the right to the
same conditions of supply for the period of a year, after which this right may
be extended yearly or indefinitely if the situation of poverty persists.

The fall in revenues in supply companies will not affect consumers, and these
companies will not be able to claim from the state." />
