of resources and a balanced policy of communications across the region. In order
to do so, we have set four basic goals in plan for infrastructure for the next
term of office:

 * Substantial improvement to establish a high frequency commuter service,
   giving Asturias the necessary ease of travel.
 * Finalisation of the pending sections of La Espina dual carriageway.
 * Elimination of the toll in Huerna, with the aim of granting Asturias a direct
   free access to improve the economic development of the region.
 * Protection of citizens from acoustic, visual and atmospheric pollution
   generated by big infrastructures (dual carriageways, expressways and
   railways) going through urban areas." />
