	<meta property="og:description" content="After a six-hour school day, our children in elementary school arrive home to
continue their working day, lasting even eight or ten hours on some days. There
are many different ways of learning: playing, imagining, creating, drawing or
developing other enjoyable non-school activities.

Thus, we propose that the new Educational Law should allow for the rest and
enjoyment of our children after their school day. We will therefore develop an
educational system where different types of teaching and learning will be
supported. In this way, exercises will be done at school, within a realistic
timeframe for their completion, while work developed at home will only be that
which is unfinished at school so that our children will be able to enjoy their
parents and their free time." />
