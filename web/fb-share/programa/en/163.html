	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Support plan for high level athletes" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="In recent years we have seen how many of our more renowned and successful
athletes have ended their careers and, for various reasons, not only have been
unable to fit into the community and share all their knowledge and experience,
but also in some cases have had a tragic end. Because of this, we feel the
obligation to offer a system that can handle this transition and ensure their
access to institutions where they can be of value.

We will promote a National Plan for the Integral Support and Training of High
Level Athletes in School and Colleges, which is directly connected to academic
training and coordinates with sporting activities, in addition to developing a
sports culture within academic institutions. This plan will develop specific
programmes according to the needs and areas of involvement:

Academic Programme for primary and secondary schools.

Development Programme for college sports and athletes.

Access plan to state employment and admission as state employees in departments
that could benefit the most from the knowledge and experience acquired by high
level athletes. This will translate as a pool of positions in the state sector
in the following departments:

Ministry of Defence: 3% of the public jobs available to be distributed among the
different corps: Chiefs of Staff, Army, Air Force, Navy and General Staff.

Ministry of the Interior: 2% of public jobs among the different corps: National
Police Corp, Civil Guard, Penitentiary Institutions, Civil Protection, Emergency
Services and Traffic police.

Ministry of Finance and Public Administration: 2% of jobs in departments of
Customs and Excise.

Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports: 2% of jobs.

Access Tests adapted to this group.

A guarantee of work flexibility with shifts and duties that allow for
coordination with training and competitions." />
