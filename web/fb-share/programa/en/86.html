through a bond exchange to enable old bonds to be replaced by new bonds which
will be maintained indefinitely. The ECB would be the institution that should
acquire, at nominal value, the old bonds and exchange them for new ones at 0%
interest in order to keep them within balance indefinitely. The ECB should
restructure the public debt of Eurozone economies when it is in excess of 60% of
GDP." />
