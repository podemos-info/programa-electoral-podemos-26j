	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Expanding the Freedom of Information Act" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will improve the current law so that it is in line with international
standards thanks to the following changes:

To recognize the right of access to information as a fundamental right. Improve
state freedom of information website accessibility and speed up requests and
inquiries. To eliminate compulsory electronic ID for those who make queries.
Reduce the response time limits to leave no room for alteration and establish a
regime of sanctions if these response time limits are breached. To ensure public
information by default. Active transparency and open formats will be the guiding
principles of the government’s actions. To ensure the independence of the
Freedom of Information Council. To establish a binding legal obligation of all
institutions with ownership or public funding: the Royal House, the General
Council of the Judiciary, political parties, trade unions and business
organizations to be accountable and to publish their results online. To set a
time-limit of a minimum of ten years before former senior officials are
permitted to intervene in a work area directly affected by decisions they took
during the exercise of their public responsibilities." />
