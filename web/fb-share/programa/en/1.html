	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: National Plan of Energy Transition" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will create a National Plan of Energy Transition to raise public-private
investment in energy efficiency and green energy by an annual 1.5% of GDP during
a period of twenty years. The purpose is to transform the productive apparatus,
building methods and the transport sector to move forward to a low carbon
economy distinguished by its use of renewable energies. The application of this
plan will allow a reduction by 30% of national primary energy consumption, while
a large proportion of the rest of the consumption will be covered by nationally
produced renewal energy, so that external energy dependence will be reduced.
Thus we will also achieve a significant reduction in CO₂ emission and a strong
boost to employment, both in sectors afflicted by unemployment that was
generated by the end of the housing bubble and in professional sectors of high
technical qualification. In the first year of the pla’s implementation 300,000
stable jobs will be created, this number will increase up to 400,000 in the
final stage. This national plan is sustained by two main pillars:

 * National Energy-Saving plan: orientated towards improving energy efficiency
   in buildings, in transport, industry and electric distribution systems. The
   spinal column of this plan is the restoration of 200,000 homes per year,
   dealing with thermal insulation, the installation of heating and warm water
   systems and energy saving lighting. These reforms will produce an 80% saving
   in the energy demand of restored housing.
 * National Renewable Energy Plan: focused on the expansion and installation of
   clean renewable energy such as solar, wind, geothermal, small hydropower and
   low emission biomass. This plan includes the whole chain from investment,
   development, manufacturing through to installation, and it will be especially
   focused on the reduction of fossil fuel consumption, also creating an
   industrial framework of high added value. Both plans should be organized in
   order to prioritize the democratization and redistribution of energy
   generation and distribution processes, so that new production systems will be
   owned by councils, consumers or small businesses." />
