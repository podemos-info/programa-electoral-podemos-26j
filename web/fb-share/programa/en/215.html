	<meta property="og:description" content="The aim is to guarantee the right of citizens to access culture, the protection
of creators, sustainability and the plurality of cultural diffusion models in
the digital environment:

 * We will support and encourage legal platforms for access to works and
   cultural content, promoting new business models that offer legal and
   attractive alternatives to citizens. We will not just encourage these
   platforms in economic terms, but establish a mediation framework between
   holders of rights in relation to different means of access and legal
   platforms for cultural works.
 * We will create an expert commission in order to overcome an ineffective
   model, based on the repression of nonprofit content downloading, and achieve
   the necessary balance between free access of citizens to culture and the
   maintenance of the authors, right holders, cultural industries and technology
   companies. On this expert committee all interested parties will be
   represented with a commitment to assess and weigh up these models, as well as
   seeking remuneration alternatives or compensation for creators and other
   rights holders by new uses made of their works on the Internet." />
