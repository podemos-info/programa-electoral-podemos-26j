	<meta property="og:description" content="We will eliminate all groups excluded from health coverage and resume a
universal health system to be applied immediately to all those returned
emigrants and to incorporate them into the health system of the receptor country
through the following measures:

 * Issuing of the European Health Card for emigrants in the European Union
   territory, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland without
   restrictions due to the employment of the applicant.
 * Suppression of the exclusion from the European Health Card of those long term
   unemployed who have had to leave the country for over 90 days. Renewal of the
   European Health Card for students who have extended their period of studies
   abroad.
 * Promotion of agreements outside the European Union to guarantee health
   coverage to emigrants until they are included in the health system of their
   country of destination. Guarantee immediate health coverage to Spanish
   emigrants returned to the country." />
