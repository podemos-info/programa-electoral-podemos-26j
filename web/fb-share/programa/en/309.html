	<meta property="og:description" content="* The access to the voting census will be performed through the municipal
   register, without additional requirements.
 * We will regulate voting rights by reforming the Statutory Law of the General
   Electoral System, and not by means of international bilateral treaties. We
   will recognize the passive right to vote of all foreign residents and not
   only those from the European Union.
 * We will significantly reduce the residency periods required to access those
   rights.
 * We will suppress the prohibition of foreigners to create political parties,
   as is now in Statutory Law 6\2002, 27th June 27th, on Political Parties.
 * We will study the viability of incorporating into the current constitutional
   framework the participation of foreign population in regional elections and
   referenda." />
