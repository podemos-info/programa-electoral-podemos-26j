	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Better regulation of the financial system" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote the full separation of consumer and investment banking. This
separation in line with the Vickers Report, recently approved in the United
Kingdom, or the Volcker Rule in the United States, will avoid situations of
moral danger in which speculative activities related to investment banking may
threaten the solvency of consumer deposits and thus require subsequent public
bailouts.

We will conduct an independent audit of all financial institutions that have
received public bailout to determine which should be taken on by the private
banking system.

We will create a public institution for state banking consumer protection and
institutional protection of the consumer will be improved. We will support
alternative forms of financing, such as credit cooperatives, ethical banking or
crowd funding.

We will propose limits on the concentration of deposits, the size of banks and
bank concentration.

The current economic crisis has led to a greater concentration of the banking
system. Some banks have experienced excessive growth and pose a systemic risk to
the economy, so it is necessary to limit the moral danger associated with the
fact that they are &#34;too big to fail&#34;. To do this, we will study whether to
impose limits on the concentration of deposits, loans and other banking
indicators; in short, the size of banks.

We will begin regulating the so-called &#39;shadow banking system&#39;. We will adopt
measures to control and regulate off-balance sheet financial activities in
Spain; also we will urge the members of the Eurogroup to do the same. These
off-balance sheet financial activities allow the circumvention of banking
regulations, transmits credit risks to third parties and produce uncontrolled
leverage. In this sense, we will move forwards in the public regulation of
securities and credit default swaps (CDS)" />
