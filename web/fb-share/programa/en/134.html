	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Reform of law 18 / 2007, of 28th December, of the right to housing" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We propose a new concept in housing planning with two important new features:
affecting private housing and the establishment of development, intervention and
market control measures.

 * To create an institutional agreement to establish the programme directives in
   the matter of housing.
 * To regulate the composition of a round table of agreement with representation
   of the State, autonomous regions, municipalities, public housing
   associations, the voluntary sector, tenants etc.
 * To prohibit the privatization of the public pool of rental homes.
 * To create judicial bodies which incentivize the passing of usufruct of
   property owners to public housing administrations in order to create a public
   pool of homes for social rent (with the guarantee of payment and upkeep).
 * To define the sanctioning process in the case of lack of fulfilment of the
   social use of the property on the part of the owners of more than ten
   properties, with the special aggravating circumstance or situations of
   dereliction, because of the harm done to the town and its inhabitants. The
   procedure will include obligatory transfer in serious cases.
 * To levy a tax on owners of empty properties.
 * To calculate the percentage of houses available for accessible rent.
 * To establish a framework of negotiation between the State, the bank and the
   funds, in which certain compensations will be demanded, in exchange for the
   thousands of millions of Euros spent on the bank bail-out, in order to
   generate a pool of accessible, social rental housing.
 * To recognize and promote new forms of ownership, such as the transfer of use,
   the usufruct or rental cooperatives.
 * To promote new professionals and new management models to re-launch public
   housing and generate a social economy around this basic need which will allow
   the defence, reinforcement or creation (depending on the individual case) of
   public housing entities, housing cooperatives with transfer of use system,
   private companies, professionals, non-profit making or limited profit-making
   which manage accessible housing in accordance with public policies, whilst
   guaranteeing their independence, and entities of the same type as those
   mentioned, but which manage social rentals (and which therefore require and
   receive more public help to be able to function).
 * To promote tenants associations, with the aim of defending the interests of
   this group in relation to the market (better services) and the administration
   (more and better help)." />
