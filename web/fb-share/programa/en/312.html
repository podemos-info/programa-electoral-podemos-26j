	<meta property="og:description" content="We will articulate legal and safe ways of entry into Spain, and especially work
towards the easing of the processes of family reunification.

We will implement new visa policy of different types, such as job searching,
allowing a temporary stay in Spain and return to the country of origin if you
have not managed to find a job, without banning re-entry.

The renewal of residence permits will not be linked exclusively to possession of
an existing contract or a job offer, and social integration residence permits
will become more flexible." />
