	<meta property="og:description" content="We will depoliticize the Constitutional Court via two reforms:

 * We will establish a new system of appointments by &#34;rejection quota”: the
   negotiation of appointments will start with the formation of an extensive
   list of all technically qualified people. From this list, each of the parties
   can discard a number from that list that is proportional to its parliamentary
   entity. After successive processes of elimination, there will be a list of
   those which have generated the least rejection. No one on the list will
   therefore be appointed by anyone or will be beholden to anyone.
   
   
 * We will repeal the &#34;express reform&#34; of the Statutory Act Proposal to reform
   the Statutory Law 2/1979, of 3rd October of the Constitutional Court, so that
   the Constitutional Court will not assume responsibilities such as the
   suspension of the functions of any authority." />
