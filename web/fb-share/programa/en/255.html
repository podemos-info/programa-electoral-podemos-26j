	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Comprehensive reform of the prosecution service" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will launch a comprehensive reform of the Prosecutor&#39;s Office with the
following proposals:

 * To review the system of appointment of the Prosecutor General.
 * To reform the Statutory Law of Public Prosecution in order to introduce
   mechanisms which ensure the independence of the prosecution process (both in
   organizational and functional terms) in relation to the executive.
 * To provide this institution with mechanisms of transparency that reveal,
   among other things, its functions, decision-making criteria, the agenda of
   the Attorney General and other governing bodies, and the remuneration or
   parameters of its activity.
 * To ensure the budgetary autonomy of the prosecution service, as a specific
   item in the State budget.
 * To comprehensively address the reorganization and new design features of the
   central bodies (Tax Inspection, Support Unit and Technical Secretariat).
   Democratize appointments under strict criteria of merit and ability." />
