	<meta property="og:description" content="We will reform the 9/ 2011 27th July Army Members’ Rights and Duties Law, in
order to promote a new regulation of fundamental rights such as freedom of
assembly, right of gathering, right to protest, right of association, freedom of
speech, right to unionize, and right to affiliate to political parties.

We will also eliminate deprivation of freedom without effective judicial
protection, and will renew the bodies for participation according to democratic
criteria, that will also be binding when it comes to law-making processes in the
professional, social, and economic spheres." />
