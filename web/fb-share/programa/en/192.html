	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Strategic Plan for Work and Family Life Balance" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will establish a Strategic Plan for Work and Family Life Balance which will
incorporate all relevant agents and evaluate public policy implemented in this
area during the last ten years. The fundamental objective of this strategic plan
is to support upbringing and care, within the family, of children, adolescents
and dependent adults.

 * We will support measures that lead to more adequate timetables for carers,
   such as more flexible hours, distance working via Internet or leave of
   absence to care for children, adolescents or dependent adults.
 * We will declare the universal right to infant public education which is free
   from 0 years of age, and will put in place its gradual implementation.
 * We will promote contractual clauses that allow for a shorter working day with
   full-time hours, as well as the coordination of school and work timetables.
 * We will reform the parental leave system following the birth or adoption of
   children, establishing a gradual increase in paternity leave until it equates
   to maternity leave. In order of ensure that effective equality of rights is
   maintained, the length of leave of absence must be the same for each parent,
   non-transferable and taken on 100% of salary. Besides, the position must be
   equally guaranteed to each parent as they exercise their right to parental
   leave.
 * We will expand the respite plans for carers of children, adolescents and
   dependent adults, paying particular attention to single-parent families." />
