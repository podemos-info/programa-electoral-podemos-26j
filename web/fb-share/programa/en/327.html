	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Greater autonomy of Spain and Europe in NATO" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will seek to provide greater strategic autonomy to both Europe and Spain
within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), for delving into the
Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and the European Defence Agency (EDA)
to address the relations with our environment and global issues from an
exclusively European perspective. In this respect, we will defend the
neutralization of the destabilizing role of NATO in Eastern Europe, freeze the
current borders of the alliance and stop installation of the missile shield in
Eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea.

In the medium term, we will support the compatibility of the alliance with a
European security architecture in which Russia participates, on the basis of a
revival of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)." />
