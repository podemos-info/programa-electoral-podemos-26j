	<meta property="og:description" content="We will implement a Strategic Plan for the migration to free software, tools and
open data, with the aim of replacing commercial tools whenever possible, and to
achieve real control of the technology used by the administration to handle its
data. To this end:

 * We will implement free software in public administration, accompanied by a
   training programme for public employees in the use of new tools.
 * We will generalize the use of open formats in the public administration.
 * We will promote productive and social networks in the sector rich in
   innovation and job creation.
 * We will support computer security and privacy as an integral right of the
   21st century, and offer legal cover to those who report offences in this
   area." />
