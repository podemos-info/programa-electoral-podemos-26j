	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Rebalancing of collective negotiation" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will rebalance collective negotiation in order to establish the pre-eminence
of sectorial agreements over the company agreements related to basic rights. In
addition the regulation of opt-out clauses in collective bargaining agreements
may be modified. Likewise, we recognize the group of main companies as a unit of
negotiation and, for this reason, all those companies which have a high level of
dependence on a main company, should form a group of those participating in the
same productive process. We will establish a new regime of validity and
automatic extension of collective bargaining agreements. Thus, the aim is not to
weaken the contractual power of workers’ representation.

For the purpose of improving the efficacy of company systems of representation,
we will spread the scope of representation to those companies and work centres
without unitary representation. In this way, a system of union representation
will be established whereby all workers belonging to the same business sector
are grouped together.

Finally, we will strengthen the guarantee of the right to strike under the
principle of unilateralism, which will be achieved by the elimination of the
specific points related to the exercise of this right in the Penal Code. Thus,
we will regulate a system of guarantees for people who decide to participate in
a strike." />
