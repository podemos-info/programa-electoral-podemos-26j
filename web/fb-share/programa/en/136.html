	<title>PODEMOS. 13 700 million Euros for state education:  free, close-by school places for all children</title>
	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: 13 700 million Euros for state education:  free, close-by school places for all children" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will proceed in progressively increasing the budget intended for education
throughout the term in office until 13,700 million Euros is reached by the end
of 2020.

As far as is possible, we will aim to reach the objective of 15,600 million
Euros in education spending, which will situate us at the average level of
expenditure of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) with 5.6% of GDP. In the long term, we will work to achieve
an expenditure on education in Spain of 7% of GDP.

We will promote quality free, secular, state education as a central pillar of
the education system and we will guarantee that, once the mid-term point has
passed, there will be free, state school places close to home for all children:

 * The offer of places in state-subsidized private schools will continue to be
   funded with public money only when absolutely necessary, that is, when there
   are insufficient places in public centres. (In order to alleviate these
   deficiencies, the percentage of public funds going to the state network will
   be progressively increased).
 * A secular curriculum will be taught on the basis that religious beliefs are a
   private, individual matter.
 * We will adhere to a policy of “inclusivity” and assure equal opportunities
   after the obligatory stage of schooling.
 * We will promote creativity, critical thought, the spirit of solidarity and
   deep respectfulness for human rights and the environment." />
