	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a plan for sustainable tourism, via specific agreements with
various agents and within a timescale of fifteen years which will establish new
bases for the development of a new tourism model for Spain and for each of its
regions and tourist towns.

We will establish a new regulatory framework for tourism related to its
environmental, cultural and social impact by means of the creation of a green
label, promoted by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism, with the
participation of autonomous regions, associations, companies, unions, ecological
research and management organisms and other social agents in each area, such as
town councils or local action groups.

We will ensure sustainable productive processes via adequate regulation of
transport systems of supplies, packaging and recycling. We will promote the
development of management models of tourist area establishments and services as
well as the institutions which participate in them, based on eco-efficient
criteria.

We will promote the development of tourist destinations which are managed by
participative organisms capable of incorporating the interests of various
agents: business people, workers, citizens, managers, researchers, technicians
and responsible politicians." />
