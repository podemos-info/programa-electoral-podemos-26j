	<meta property="og:description" content="We will open a broad public debate on the recognition and ways to exercise the
right to decide within the framework of the general debate about a
constitutional change. We will constitutionally recognize the nature of Spain,
as a state with many nations, and we will also ensure the right of regional
governments to hold referenda in order to consult with citizens an appropriate
regional model for the country.

That is to say, we will promote the calling of a referendum with guarantees in
Cataluña so that its citizens can decide the type of territorial relationship
they wish to establish with the rest of Spain.

We will recover mutual respect as a basic foundation for relations between
governments and parliaments at all levels within the State.

We will start a process of constitutional change orientated towards the
resolution of, among other things; State territorial structure issues and will
evaluate and debate the cases of the United Kingdom and Canada." />
