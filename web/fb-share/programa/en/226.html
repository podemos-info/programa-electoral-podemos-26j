	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a regulatory framework so that the voice of the general public
will be heard in public institutions, and we will incorporate public knowledge
and sense into parliamentary debates through various and inclusive instruments
of participation:

 * Popular Legislative Initiative (PLI). We will remove current obstacles, from
   the strict requirements for submission to the lack of parliamentary debate.
 * Popular Initiative of Deliberative Processes. This will be used to open a
   process of public deliberation (participatory budgets, use of public spaces,
   etc.) upon request by popular initiative.
 * Initiative of Popular Veto. This is an instrument of direct democracy which
   shows public opposition to certain rules that affect them directly.
 * Popular Referendum Initiative. This allows people to initiate a consultation
   in the relevant area of competence.
 * Popular Recall. This will occur in the specific case of loss of legitimacy of
   the individuals who represent us." />
