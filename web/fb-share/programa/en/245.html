	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Judicial police and the functional assignment of experts to the courts" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will work to make these public servants, both the judicial police and
experts, functionally dependent on the courts, and so that they have control
over police investigations or criminal proceedings. Thus both undue delays can
be avoided including as a result of the removal of &#34;uncomfortable&#34; agents. These
police units must meet the following requirements:

 * To be temporarily, functionally assigned to courts or tribunals.
 * To have an independent structure and a very small number of freely appointed
   positions.
 * To be made up of officials with proven experience in the Judicial Police, and
   with exclusive access via a specific competitive examination.

To promote and conduct investigation on open court cases:

 * They will be delegated by the judge or prosecutor within the judiciary.
 * They may requisition from the police all the personal and material means
   needed bring the investigation to a successful conclusion.
 * They will not be required to report on the developments of their
   investigation or on its results." />
