which are specialized in matters of military discipline and punishment, carried
out by judges and magistrates with appropriate training and integrated into the
jurisdiction orders of administrative-contention and penal law. We will also
suppress Room V of the Military Supreme Court for reasons of economy,
independence and transparency. The present make-up of the military justice
system does not guarantee its full independence from military command." />
