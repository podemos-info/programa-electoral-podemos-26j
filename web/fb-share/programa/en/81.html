	<meta property="og:description" content="We will abandon the policy of wage devaluation as a way of promoting
competitiveness because of its negative social and economic effects. To do this,
we will repeal the last two labour reform laws and will adopt measures to
promote sufficient growth of wages and improve purchasing power. Also we will
strengthen the role of collective bargaining by repealing the measures included
in the most recent labour reform. We will increase the minimum wage and end wage
cuts in the public sector." />
