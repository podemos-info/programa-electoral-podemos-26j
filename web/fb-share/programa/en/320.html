the UN, to combat tax evasion or tax competition between countries that have
sanctioning capacity and we will require multinational corporations to pay their
taxes where they generate profits. The agency will aim:

 * To study the creation of a global wealth tax to gradually tax large blocks of
   wealth as a guarantee of social rights.
 * The adoption of a tax on financial transactions.
 * Fixing a universal definition and binding rules for tax havens." />
