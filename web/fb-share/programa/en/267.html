	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Direct management of public administration and optimization of professional performance" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will guarantee the principle of direct management of public services, and the
exercise of public competencies and prerogatives within the national
administration.

Those competencies that have been privatized or outsourced will be recovered,
and our decisions will always be oriented towards the common good and general
interest.

In order to get the best out of each professional in the management of public
services, we will commit to an adaptation of the profile of each individual to
the tasks they will undertake, so as to optimize the value of their work, and
also help in their promotion within their area of work.

Motivation is the key factor when it comes to direct management, and we will
regain it using three basic tools:

 * Team work, with professionally legitimized leaderships.
 * Proper quality training.
 * Adjustment of the requirements to enjoy administrative leave connected with
   training and also obtaining professional experience abroad." />
