of landscape from a perspective of safeguarding and forbidding actions which may
have an irreversible negative impact on the landscape. We will unify landscape
policies and ensure that landscape planning and protection are integrated into
global regional planning. In this respect, we will implement a participative
planning model, in accordance with the requirements outlined in the European
Convention, so that it is society at large which defines quality objectives of
their landscape." />
