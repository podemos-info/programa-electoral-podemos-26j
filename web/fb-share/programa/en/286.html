	<meta property="og:title" content="Podemos - Promoting circular economy:
Objective: zero waste" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will follow the EC Waste Framework Directive and we will study the
transposition of this Directive into Spanish law, beginning with safety and
prevention principles. We will develop increased producer responsibility so
that, based on rigorous and independent research, the producer will assume the
real costs of waste management at all levels, and also the development of
measures to reach the goals set in the Waste Framework Directive.

We will develop a circular economy to guarantee the reduction in the use of
natural resources in our economy. We will set in motion effective waste
management policies that work towards the elimination of obsolescence, reducing
waste generation through eco-design, selective separation of organic matter for
compost, etc.

We will redefine the function of Recycling Points and Mobile Recycling units so
as to improve the quantity and, above all, the quality of the products that are
collected, and we will set in motion simple preparation operations for
recycling, aiming to double recycling in ten years.

We will encourage the second-hand market and the separation of goods such as
furniture and electronic and electrical equipment." />
