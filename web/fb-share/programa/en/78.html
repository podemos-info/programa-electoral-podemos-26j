	<meta property="og:description" content="We will approve a Plan of Social Welfare and Economic Modernization aimed, on
the one hand, at social policies that strengthen the welfare state and public
services related to care for people, and secondly, to boost public investment,
job creation and a real transformation of our economy. This plan will be endowed
with a budget increase of 25 billion Euros each year during the term of office.
In this way, we will increase by one point the percentage of GDP spending, and
will bring us closer to Europe rather than taking us further away, as would
happen with the reduction by four percentage points proposed by the Popular
Party (PP)" />
