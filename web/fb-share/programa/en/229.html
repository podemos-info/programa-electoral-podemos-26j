	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: New territorial model based on five conceptual axes" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will implement a new territorial model based on the following conceptual
axes:

 * Construction of a new democratic and inclusive governance.
 * Principles of autonomy, subordination, efficiency, accountability and
   democratic control.
 * Local sphere as key in the proximity of the welfare state.
 * Reducing inefficient organizational levels.
 * An equitable and sufficient funding system to maintain essential public
   services.

In provincial deputy councils (and equivalent):

 * Progressive assumption of powers and resources of provincial deputy councils
   until their constitutional suppression.
 * Regional coordination of the current functions of the provincial councils.

In municipalities:

 * Return of the responsibility for social welfare to municipalities.
 * Revision of the financing system.
 * Abolition of the authorization of the Council or Ministers to hold local
   referendums. In metropolitan areas and districts:
 * Recognition and articulation of metropolitan shared management of common
   services because of their proximity and democratic control of its management.
 * Allocation of resources by municipalities with sufficient guarantee of state
   contribution." />
