	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Respect to decide about one’s own pregnancy, birth and postnatal period" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote treatment (within the health system) of maternity that respects
and accepts all needs and decisions of women through the following measures:

 * Facilitating access to a clear and complete information for all women during
   all stages of pregnancy and birth.
 * Promoting the freedom to decide about the medical treatments in pregnancy and
   birth, strengthening practices that encourage the prominence of women and
   their ability to make responsible decisions during pregnancy and the
   post-natal period. We will also strengthen the figure of midwives during the
   preparation and birth phases.
 * Reducing the number of caesarean sections and induced births to the figures
   recommended by the protocols of World Health Organisation (15 %) and adapt
   birth preparation to the schedules of working women.
 * Offering facilities for women who choose to have an extended breastfeeding
   period.
 * Facilitate and guarantee the practice of breastfeeding and other care tasks
   after the four months’ statutory leave period. We will also encourage the
   training of the primary assistance public health staff in matters of
   breastfeeding." />
