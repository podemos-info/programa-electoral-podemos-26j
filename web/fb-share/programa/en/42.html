	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Appointment of an observing body that will guarantee the availability of open information about access and management processes in research institutions and universities" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="In order to end a lack of access to information, especially with regards to
entry and selection processes in research institutions and universities, we will
appoint an observing body that will ensure that information is always accessible
about research institutions and universities&#39; access and management processes.

Furthermore, the observing body will act against other systemic problems in
these institutions that provoke arbitrary decisions and injustices in the access
to teaching and research careers, as exemplified by the precarious nature of
staff salaries.

The observing body will form part of a future evaluation agency and will serve
as an alarm system against problems arising from a lack of access to information
in public research institutions and universities. It will be an organism open to
society at large and receptive to complaints about the lack of access to
information and lack of fairness in the Spanish research system." />
