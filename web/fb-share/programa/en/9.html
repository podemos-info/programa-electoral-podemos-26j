	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Leading role of renewable energies in electrical system planning" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will place renewable energies in the centre of electrical system planning.
Whilst they are still necessary, all other technologies will work as support to
these. By this we mean:

 * We will investigate how many combined cycle power plants are not needed
   without changing the current guarantee of supply standards. Expendable
   combined cycle power plants will not receive any kind of payment for
   capacity.
 * We will proceed to the gradual closure of nuclear power plants working in
   Spain.
 * We will carry out the gradual closure of coal-fired power plants.

The gradual abandonment of energy sources connected to combined cycle power
plants, nuclear or coal, will take place within the framework of a fair
transition for workers in these industries, so that their progressive relocation
to these clean energy sectors will be ensured on equal terms." />
