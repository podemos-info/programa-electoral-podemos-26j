	<meta property="og:description" content="Culture is a basic right, a public good and a strategic production sector that
requires a ministry that attends to its specific needs. Therefore, we will
create a Ministry of Culture and Communication with an organizational structure
that is adjusted to the particularities of the cultural sector. The complex
contemporary integration between communication and culture, determined by the
digital era, requires a plan to join these two areas in the same public policy.
The creation of a ministry to articulate this relationship will allow the
establishment of coordinated policies able to boost circulation, production,
transmission and creation of the senses. In this new framework, the Ministry of
Culture and Communication will carry out the following actions:

To develop operational plans that, unlike the current general or strategic plans
(limited and without effect), will articulate cultural policies; will ensure
methods of implementation and will establish procedures for supervision, review,
evaluation and accountability.

Reforming the organizational structure to respond to the current reality of the
artistic and cultural world, including new features such as the General
Directorship of Digital Culture, providing autonomy and reformulating the
structure and the shape of operation of some of its agencies, such as the
Institute of Film and the Audiovisual Arts (ICAA) and the National Institute for
Performance Art and Music (INAEM), to overcome the current excessive
bureaucracy, immobility and the obsolete performance models, to end its limited
receptiveness to external proposals and adapt it to current and future needs." />
