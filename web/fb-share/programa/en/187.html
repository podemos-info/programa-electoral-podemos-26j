	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a specific plan of equality for men and women and against
discrimination because of sexual identity or orientation.

We will pay attention to the legal gaps that exist in the Military Criminal Code
on the subject of sexual harassment, in order to find out its real extent in the
military.

We will create protocols on sexist violence on female personnel, intended to
avoid increasing damage to their careers by making a report.We will create a
judicial framework on the abuse of power and discrimination in the workplace on
account of gender issues in Army and State Security Forces.

We will create awareness-raising campaigns about sexual harassment in those
groups.

We will adapt work equipment and safety material to female personnel.

We will create effective measures to aid family welfare and co-responsibility,
both in the appointments within national territory and in foreign countries.

We will examine the promotion criteria in the military ranks, with the goal of
guaranteeing greater female presence in the high ranks." />
