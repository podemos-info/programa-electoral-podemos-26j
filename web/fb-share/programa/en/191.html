	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Introduction of the new Gender Identity Law" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will create a new Gender Identity Law that includes measures to guarantee the
protection of the rights of intersex persons. Furthermore, we will guarantee, if
desired, the change of name and gender in any documents already issued. We will
pay special attention to cases involving intersex children, as well as migrant
persons and will demand that all public administration institutions have
protocols set in place to deal with all cases. We will also guarantee that
intersex persons who so wish, can access professional health support, following
non-pathological criteria. We will include in the general package of services
offered by the National Health Service to intersex persons, the provision of
health care close to home, including any necessary surgery, as well as the
delivery of health care to intersex minors, so that from any location in Spain
they can access egalitarian and non-pathological care. In order to achieve this,
we will deliver the necessary clinical and psycho-social education and training
to the professionals involved.

We will outline employment plans for intersex persons and apply a quota system
in public jobs.

We will guarantee the recognition of intersex persons&#39; reproductive rights." />
