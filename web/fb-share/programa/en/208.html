	<title>PODEMOS. Steps for the responsible and efficient exercise of the Public Cultural Administration</title>
	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Steps for the responsible and efficient exercise of the Public Cultural Administration" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="Transparency will be applied to every area of the Ministry of Culture and
Communication and every organisation which depends on it, with the aim of
guaranteeing freedom of information in the management and designation of
resources, as well as immediate easy access to every item of information
connected with the Ministry or is supervised by it.

The Ministry will regulate access to positions of responsibility in cultural
matters establishing transparent and democratic processes (by means of public
competition which will include the submission of a project) with the aim of
creating a team of advisers that understand the complexity of the sector and act
with competence, dialogue, ability and efficiency.

In the same way, measures of rationality, proportionality and control will be
applied to regulate the expense of the Administration when establishing
allowances for senior positions (directors of public institutions or
organisations mostly funded with public funds), as well as the personnel hired
by the Ministry or dependent institutions or organizations devoted to
counselling or artistic and cultural activities.

When services have to be externalised, transparent mechanisms will be adopted
and we will favour the hiring of qualified professionals, eliminating the use of
strictly economic criteria in contract concession.

Moreover, the Code of Good Practice will be developed and widened, and new codes
will be created in those sectors where they currently do not exist. We will
ensure the effective establishment of such codes in every action, position
appointment and general functioning of public, mixed or publically-funded
institutions." />
