	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Towards gender equality in the labour market: reformation of the system of parental leave on the grounds of birth or adoption of a child" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will work towards gender equality in the labour market with the reform of the
system of parental leave on the grounds of birth or adoption of a child.
Furthermore, we will establish a calendar whereby paternal leave is increased
until it is equal to maternal leave. In order to guarantee effective equality of
rights, leave must be:

 * Equal and non-transferrable for every parent, as in the case of all labour
   and social rights.
 * Paid at 100 % of salary.
 * The work position of both parents must be protected during their periods of
   leave.

Furthermore, we will increase the responsibilities of work and Social Security
inspections in matters of the prohibition of discrimination in the contracting,
promotion and retribution. We will establish a state commission for monitoring
and controlliing plans for gender equality in companies which can put forward
proposals aimed at eliminating discrimination as well as a state commission for
monitoring the fight against harassment in the workplace.

In this way we will start to deal with the specific objective of eliminating the
gender salary gap, which is currently at 19% in this country." />
