	<title>PODEMOS. Comprehensive Protection Law against Child and Adolescent Violence</title>
	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Comprehensive Protection Law against Child and Adolescent Violence" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will pass a Comprehensive Protection Law against Child and Adolescent
Violence that specifically addresses different types of violence against infancy
and adolescence (trafficking, exploitation, bullying, cyber-bullying,
segregation, eviction).

This new law will promote increased understanding and categorizing of different
types of violence against infancy and adolescence within or outside of the
family unit.

The law will address the creation of a free, anonymous and secure emergency
phone number similar to that already existing for gender violence (016).

Creation of the position of Child and Adolescent Advocate, both on a state and a
local basis.

Development of campaigns against violence towards infancy and adolescence that
have as particular basic references the media, family, school, basic care and
social service teams.

Active administrative and economic support for family refuges (host families,
shelter families, etc.) of children who are victims of violence, abandonment or
trauma, as opposed to standard residential care." />
