	<meta property="og:description" content="Within a new structure of the Ministry of Culture and Communication, we will
create the Assembly of Culture Professional and the Citizens Culture
Observatory, where the entire sector is to be represented in its plurality and
complexity. These institutions will participate in the cultural administration.
Both organisms are intended to neutralize political interferences and avoid the
biased use of the management of cultural matters.

The Assembly of Culture Professional will participate in the administration of
cultural subjects with decisiveness and establish lines of dialogue between the
Administration and the cultural sector.
In this sense, the Assembly will guarantee direct efficient and transparent
principles with the aim of favouring the participation of design professionals
and the supervision and development of cultural policies. It will have a statute
that will specify the attributions, goals, responsibilities, organizational
structure, functioning and rights and responsibilities of its members.

It will have specific sector commissions (music, visual arts, scenic arts,
books, heritage, audiovisuals, communication, etc) to address the
particularities of each sector. Regarding the Citizens Culture Observatory, it
will analyse and inspect, through social return indicators, the progress of
different projects. It will look after its proper functioning; the management of
cultural resources and it will allow citizens to participate in the design and
evaluation of cultural policies." />
