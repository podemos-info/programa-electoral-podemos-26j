	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Implementing an integral plan for fighting fraud" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will set in motion an integral plan to fight against fraud that will include
the following initiatives:

 * Developing a fundamental statute to regulate the State Tax Administration
   Agency (AEAT), that will guarantee: its independence, a professional and
   objective approach, an end to the partisan use of the organisation, and an
   obligation to design consistent strategic plans. The director general of the
   AEAT will be appointed by Parliament.
 * Promoting the merger of the different revenue collection agencies that
   operate in our country. We will aim to: have them integrated on the internet,
   facilitate the flow of information with the use of integrated databases and
   ensure they adopt common strategies and objectives.
 * Passing an annual tax and customs law that will include specific measures to
   fight fraud and tax avoidance. This normative will include the modifications
   to the law that may derive from the implementation of the contract (a
   five-year AEAT programme during the reporting year). The law will be debated
   and approved once Parliament and the regional governments have implemented
   the annual control of the results in the administration of revenue and
   customs carried out by AEAT and by the regional revenue and customs services
   and agencies.
 * Public employment offer. A gradual increase in AEAT&#39;s staff, taking into
   account its logistics capabilities and the need for professional
   qualifications.
 * Establishing a commission of experts in the fight against fraud who will
   propose measures to curb fiscal volatility, tax avoidance, base line erosion
   and the transfer of profits.
 * Approve a packet of measures against tax havens that include the following
   elements: measures to reveal the names of anyone holding accounts in tax
   havens, measures that address access to financial information, supervision
   and control measures and penalty measures. These measures will be implemented
   with particular attention in the case of multinational corporations.
 * End tax avoidance using shell companies. There will be an examination of the
   tax affairs of SICAV funds, SOCIMI (the Spanish REIT) companies, hedge funds
   and holding companies (ETVE) in order to secure productive investment and
   fiscal fairness. The drafting of agreements will be reviewed so as to
   eliminate double taxation and include measures against tax avoidance." />
