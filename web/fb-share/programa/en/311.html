migration based on coordination of work between ministries related to migration
and diversity in addition this bureau will consolidate migration
responsibilities, currently shared by the Ministry of Employment and Social
Security, Interior and Foreign Affairs and Cooperation.

The current General Bureau of Immigration and Emigration will recover its status
as Bureau of State and renamed Bureau of Migration Policies.

It will carry out tasks of assessment, measuring and monitoring of financed
projects, and will focus on public rather than outsourced employment." />
