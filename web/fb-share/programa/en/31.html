	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Bringing Science closer to society: Citizen Innovation Centres" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="In order to bring science into our everyday lives we propose, on the one hand,
to set up Citizen Innovation Centres. These will become meeting points between
science and society in local communities, with support from town halls and
universities. They will focus on promoting science, social innovation and the
development of a truly citizen-centred science, a culture of curiosity and
know-how. On the other hand, we also propose to establish Science Shops, units
which, with the support of experts, promote investigation through talks,
projects and technical studies which respond to the doubts and specific
scientific problems of the citizens.

At the same time, we will develop an online bank of scientific resources for the
whole of society, with activities that can be undertaken in the family home,
youth centres, day centres for the elderly, etc.

In addition, we will create links between these centres, educational
institutions, universities, research institutes, scientific corporations and
society as a whole.

School visits to scientific centres will be organised, and alongside these we
will publicise the social benefits which such visits offer. Public events will
also be organised in day centres for the elderly." />
