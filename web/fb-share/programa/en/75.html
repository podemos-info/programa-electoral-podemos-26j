in the digital economy, by promoting hubs (small business centres) and
innovation clusters. We will encourage access to workspaces and co-working
(collaborative work) the incubators of entrepreneurs and business start-ups, to
be able to create a network of collaboration spaces that enable small
entrepreneurs to pool resources, provide shared services and facilitate
innovation in a decentralized way, so that the general public and the productive
sectors may benefit. We will promote public funding in these sectors and
public-private partnership to produce digital applications of general interest.
On the other hand, we will regulate the collaborative economy to provide a clear
and also legal framework; we will encourage the incorporation of services and
collaborative digital economy by the government." />
