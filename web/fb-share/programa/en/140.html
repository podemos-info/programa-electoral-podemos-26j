	<meta property="og:description" content="We will develop a Plan for Integrated Learning of Foreign Languages for both
primary and secondary education, aimed at improving the learning of foreign
languages and to combat the social segregation associated with the current
differentiated curriculum.

 * The plan must guarantee that there is no inequality between pupils of
   different social origins.
 * The plan will be developed during the course of four school years. In the
   first year there will be a diagnosis and evaluation of the current situation
   and a new plan will be agreed by the educational community. During the second
   and third years a pilot programme will be created in various centres, which
   will then be re-evaluated. Finally, during the fourth year the plan will be
   extended to all school centres in the country." />
