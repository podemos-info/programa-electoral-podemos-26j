	<meta property="og:description" content="We will modify the Program of Development of Agricultural Employment (PFEA) in
order to ensure stable and sustainable employment in rural areas in
agricultural, agri-food and forestry projects and also in other sectors related
to the conservation and maintenance of territory and of the natural, historical
and landscape heritage of rural areas.

We will put an end to citizen dependency and patronage practices of town
councils and entrepreneurs in the area of agriculture through the implementation
of a Zero Poverty programme which will enable universalized rents and limit the
requirement of signing up a daily work force. Thus, both the subsidy and
agricultural incomes will be integrated into a perspective that will ensure a
decent life for a particularly vulnerable group such as agricultural workers" />
