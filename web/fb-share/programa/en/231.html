	<meta property="og:description" content="We will expand the electoral process from two to four weeks, so there will be a
greater margin for the sending of ballot papers. We will replace the vote by
request by the automatic and regular update of the Electoral Roll of Absent
Residents (ERAR) by the voter registration renewal every five years. We will
create an external constituency to give voice to emigrants and channel their
demands. We will change the voting procedure by mail to a mixed one. We will
extend the possibility for displaced residents abroad to register as Voters
Living Away Temporarily (VLAT). We will extend the right to municipal voting to
residents with less than five years outside the municipality. We will facilitate
access to consular services by electronic means and consular opening times. We
will improve the electoral information provided by the State. We will regulate
campaigns abroad." />
