	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: A New Law of Patronage and Sponsorship and a Social Fund for Culture" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will introduce a new Law of Patronage and Sponsorship to promote patronage at
macro and micro levels, and encourage individuals and organizations to
participate in the funding of cultural initiatives. This law will rekindle
public and private collaboration and will be linked to the creation of a Social
Fund for Culture. The administration of this fund will be carried out
collaboratively between the Ministry of Culture and Communication, the Culture
Professionals&#39; Assembly and the Citizen Culture Observer, in an effort to
encourage private individuals who are professionally involved in culture and
society at large to get involved with public administration institutions. This
fund will open the door to the launching of projects throughout the year and its
administration will be based around the following areas: funding, facilitating
and promoting projects, institutions, initiatives, enterprises and individuals
who are involved in the realms of elaboration, education, research,
dissemination, distribution, conservation, production and development of
projects related to art and culture in its widest sense. It will be funded from
the following sources:

 * The 18% of revenue from taxes imposed on cultural transactions between
   individuals or organizations.
 * A new allocation earmarked for cultural activities (Cultural Allocation)
   which will be introduced in the 100 model of the personal income tax
   declaration.
 * The 1.5% cultural portion of the Historic Heritage Law which demands that
   this percentage of the budget for public works contract agreements must be
   used for heritage conservation or protection work and the promotion of
   artistic creativity. The Ministry of Public Works at present shares the
   responsibility for administering this. In future it will fall exclusively on
   the Ministry of Culture and Communication.
 * Voluntary donations from individuals and companies (who would be able to opt
   for variable tax exemptions).
 * Grants from central government, and other European, regional and local
   institutions intended, out of solidarity, to contribute to the fund and get
   involved in its administration.

The funding of projects from the Social Fund for Culture will be conditional to
the promotion of good practice: it will guarantee inclusivity and diversity in
cultural and artistic initiatives; promote the development of the third sector
(individuals and organizations involved in voluntary, non-profit making
activities); value and guarantee artistic, cultural and social returns; it will
be guided by principles that ensure control over the expenditure of public funds
and the monitoring of projects; it will take into consideration a wider range of
activities; it will include a more diverse range of agents, projects, activities
and initiatives than those currently receiving public grants and allowances and
will facilitate access and inclusion in its programme to independent artists and
producers. The Social Fund for Culture will make it possible to end the
connection between cultural activities funding and private, personal or
corporate interests which is so commonly found at present, and replace it
instead with a more diverse and sustainable culture. In collaboration with
regional and local institutions, the Fund will also be involved in the
redevelopment, renovation and regeneration of inadequate, under used or
abandoned spaces, so they can be used for cultural activities." />
