	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote the Law for Employment Inclusion of People with Functional
Diversity that will allow an increase of 50% in their activity rate within the
four-year term of office. In order to achieve this, a new legal frame of
employment inclusion for people with functional diversities will be proposed
that transcends the current one and focuses on individualised attention
throughout the process of incorporation in employment, promotion of training,
individualised support, activation of new innovative means of access and
employment inclusion and positive discrimination towards people with functional
diversities with greater need of support or in situation of social exclusion,
always also taking into account the gender perspective." />
