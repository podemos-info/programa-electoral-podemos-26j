	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: A new Education Law born out of debate and the participation of the educational community." />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will repeal the Statutory Law to Improve Educational Quality (LOMCE) and
promote a broad debate within the educational community to formulate a new
Education Law which counts on the greatest participation and support possible of
the educational community. Our objectives will be:

 * To put an end to the instability of the Spanish education system which, over
   the last thirty three years has seen seven different laws which have scarcely
   had any participation of the educational community.
 * The new Law of Education will focus on personal and social development of
   individuals throughout their lives. Environmental education will also be
   present as part of schools’ curricular development." />
