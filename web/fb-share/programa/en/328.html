	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Right of migration between Spain and Latin America" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will set a priority to strengthen relations with Latin America as an
important region for our country due to historical, economic and cultural ties
that bind us. We propose:

 * To encourage inter-migration with bilateral agreements that protect the
   rights of Spanish emigrants in Latin America and Latin Americans in Spain.
 * To recognize and strengthen bilateral and EU relations with the new regional
   realities of Latin America (such as the Community of Latin American and
   Caribbean States, CELAC, or the Union of South American Nations, USAN) for
   what we will promote cooperation beyond trade integration and we will favour
   special exchanges in education, research, science and cooperative social
   economy.
 * To encourage the promotion of human rights, especially in the current popular
   processes of fighting impunity and corruption in Central America.
 * To contribute to the gradual normalization of political and commercial
   relations with Cuba, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to reverse the
   common position of the European Union adopted in 1996." />
