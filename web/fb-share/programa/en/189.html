	<meta property="og:description" content="We will establish a State Observatory on LGTBIphobia to control compliance with
the law and to receive and manage complaints and to act on its own initiative.
We will also promote the creation of local observatories.

We will put in place a State Council for the Equality of LGTBI people with the
ability to make reports, research, make legal proposals and present legal
actions against alleged aggressors and discriminators.

We will create a National LGTBI Institute at the same level as the Institute for
Women and Institute for Youth.

We will make a change in article 14 of the Constitution to expressly include the
prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

We will set in place a National Plan Against School Harassment because of sexual
orientation that includes training, awareness-raising campaigns and help and
support for victims." />
