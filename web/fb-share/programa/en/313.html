	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Law 14&#34; for equality of treatment and the promotion of coexistence" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="We will adopt a comprehensive law on equality of treatment and
non-discrimination and to promote coexistence, &#34;Law 14&#34;, which will ensure the
independence of the Spanish Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and will
make it more accessible. Besides diagnostics and data collection, this
observatory will prepare proposals, preventive functions and comprehensive
assistance and protection to victims of all forms of discrimination.

We will develop and put in place a comprehensive state plan for coexistence in
which the highest priority will be community, educational and social measures to
prevent racism, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination. Measures in the
field of employment and training of public servants (especially the State
Security Forces) shall also include, as well as broadcast and media support.
This plan will promote the recovery of memory, reparation for border patrol
victims and the advance in the process of symbolic decolonization." />
