income) for all households with an income level below the poverty line. To do
this, we will increase the amount of basic benefit per person in the family
unit. Initially, this amount will be 600 Euros per month per family unit with
one member and it will then be increased according to the number of family
members (an additional 35% of guaranteed income for the second member, and 20%
for each subsequent family member) up to a maximum of 1290 Euros. This plan
includes all social benefits which are below this threshold." />
