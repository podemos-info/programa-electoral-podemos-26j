	<meta property="og:description" content="We will promote a new Law of Universities which will include an improvement in
funding, within the context of an increase in public investment in Research and
Development above 2% of GDP.

This law will be complemented by a Statute for Teaching and Research Personnel
which will consider the reinsertion of young scientists, the stability of the
career of teaching and research and mechanisms to improve gender equality.

The quality of universities is based upon its personnel which will be guaranteed
by a reform in the evaluation and certification which respects diversity of
teaching and research objectives and university autonomy.

The Law of Universities will also include a reform of its form of government
which will assure the participation of the university community and will protect
it, as a public service, from internal and external corporative interests and
which, likewise, will guarantee the transparency of its management and
accountability of results to society" />
