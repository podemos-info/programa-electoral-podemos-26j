	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Statute of the Artist and Culture Professional" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="As a stimulus to activity and to end uncertainty, we will develop and implement
a Statute of the Artist and Culture Professional, adapted to the unstable nature
of the cultural sector which includes both the activity of employed or
self-employed workers. This law will study the specificity of the irregular
income of culture professionals and will create a tax that meets their needs,
leading to fair taxation both for the Treasury and for workers.

Among other fiscal measures, we will link the liquidation of the quarterly tax
payment with the date of service provided and not with the date of issue of
invoices by the self-employed. In the case of intermittent workers, whose
incomes are high but also irregular, an assessment criterion for the purpose of
applying the corresponding tax rate will be established, in order to take into
account the progressive nature of the income as specified in the Personal Income
Tax Act. Also, the specific group headings in business tax (IAE) will be
modified to adapt to the new needs of culture professionals, with the idea of
unifying the sector and link the measures outlined to their specific
characteristics.

In the area of Social Security, we will include special arrangements for
cultural indicators, framed both in the general scheme (for employed persons)
and the autonomous scheme (for self-employed workers), in order to cover all
possible professional situations related to artists and cultural workers. We
will encourage hiring and we will eliminate false self-employment incorporating
the factor of intermittence into the general system when a specific situation so
demands. For the self-employed, we will modify the system so that they may
develop their profession without constant variations of employment and
unemployment, with the specific nature of intermittent employment and
performance to be recognized and to guarantee the payment of proportional tax
according to all income perceived. Within the Social Security system illness and
injuries related to the performance of artistic and technical work will be
recognized in order to create an unemployment regime that respects the specific
circumstances of these workers. Regarding intermittent cultural workers, we will
specify in the Statute the Supreme Court judgments of 29/10/97 and 23/09/02,
according to which registration with Social Security is not required, whenever
the professional activity performed is not the usual main income regimen,
according to the Public Indicator of Multiple Effect Income (PIMEI). Similarly,
we will modify the regime of multiple jobs in Social Security to ensure a
further reduction of payments in compensation.

The Statute of the Artist and Culture Professional will further the possibility
of making changes to the Workers&#39; Statute and the Law on Freedom of Association,
in order to guarantee the effective right of intermittent workers to be properly
represented by territorial and professional unions.

In the framework of this Statue and to encourage artistic nonprofit making
activity, the Cooperative Act will be amended in order to allow the creation of
worker cooperatives associated with intermittent workers, linking these areas to
the nature and ways of the social and voluntary economy." />
