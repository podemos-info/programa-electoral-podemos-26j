	<meta property="og:title" content="PODEMOS: Reform of the General Law of Audiovisual Communication" />
	<meta property="og:description" content="In order to bring Spanish media into line with European standards, we will carry
out a reform of the General Law of Audiovisual Communication (LGCA) focusing on
four aspects:

 * The Removal of Government control of public media (RTVE, Agencia EFE, etc.),
   and therefore guarantee their Independence and plurality, quality of contents
   and fulfilment of the right to access. In order to achieve this, we will
   promote the responsibilities and participation of News Information Councils,
   a Social Council, the Spectator’s Advocate and the areas of interactive
   media. Its presidency will be elected through public competition which will
   require a project submission.
   
   
 * Carry out a study of radio wave spectrum management criteria to guarantee a
   more balanced distribution among the three sectors of communication (public,
   commercial and third sector), and to achieve a better use of this spectrum
   (according to European standards) that guarantees the right of free
   competition and leads to an improvement of plurality ratings
   
   
 * Acknowledgment and protection of the non-profit making social community media
   (according to UNESCO recommendations). This will be complemented by the
   creation of the two terrestrial digital televisions (TDT) Open Channels and
   radio with local disconnections, managed in cooperation with those media as
   exist in Germany, Norway or Finland.
   
   
 * Creation of an Audiovisual Council, independent and integrated into the
   European Platform of Regulatory Authorities (EPRA), similar to those existing
   in some other surrounding countries." />
